The purpose of this project is to teach TDD.

If you want to practice TDD, start the development from the branch *'basic-structure'*.
You're going to implement a function to do withdraw operations.

**Rules:**

- It can not be possible to make a withdrawal when the balance in the account is insufficient;
- The account must be valid;
